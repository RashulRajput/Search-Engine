The Search-Engine project is designed to search a text file containing entries with three fields in each line, such as "Rashul Rajput 22bcs16545@cuchd.in". This program implements three different search algorithms: ANY, NONE, and ALL, to facilitate efficient and accurate searches.

**Find a Person**: Upon execution, the user is prompted to select from the three available search algorithms:

**ALL**: Print lines containing all the words from the query.
**ANY**: Print lines containing at least one word from the query.
**NONE**: Print lines that do not contain any words from the query.
**Print All People**: This option displays all entries available in the text file.
